<h1>Backup mediaWiki<h1>

Here you'll find some utilities to backup a mediaWiki website.

* Adjust the server/backup_wiki.php settings (~lines 17 to 30)
* Adjust the client/assets/applications.js script URL (~line 15)

Then you have to copy both 'server' and 'client' folders into your website. 


Go to http://myServer/myPath/client/index.html to start the backup.
