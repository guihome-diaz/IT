# ==== NFS details ====
# noatime - To speed up things by skipping the file access time registration. That will skip some write operations but it make it harder to know what has been accessed when. Only for /tmp
# atime - Register every acces. MANDATORY for NAS
# realtime - only update file timestamp if the file or directory has been modified since the last atime update. You might choose to use ‘noatime’ on most of your filesystems but leave /var/spool and /tmp as ‘relatime’
# noexec - To prevent people from running executables in /tmp. Some rootkits do that. This flag might cause trouble for some legitimate applications so be sure to test everything properly after setting this flag.
# nosuid - To prevent the setuid bit from being set on files in /tmp. 
# auto - to mount the disk on each and every boot
# rw - read / write rights
